## About me
I worked as a gravure printer. I liked my profession, but with the outbreak of war in my country, I lost my job. Front End began to study 3 months ago. I like the layout process itself, it's just unlimited career growth. I am sure that everything will work out for me and I will find a job for the position of Junior Front End Developer.
